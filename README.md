## Botium Toys: Scope, goals, and risk assessment report

### Scope and goals of the audit

#### Scope
The scope of this audit covers the entire security program at Botium Toys. The assessment includes all assets managed by the IT department, encompassing systems, devices, data, and internal processes related to security control implementation and compliance with applicable standards.
The audit evaluates not only the technologies in use, but also asset management practices, access control mechanisms, and the consistency of security control application across daily operations.

#### Goals
The primary goal of this audit is to evaluate the current security posture and identify gaps between existing practices and industry standards and best practices. The assessment focuses on reviewing existing assets and completing control and compliance checklists to determine which security measures should be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ overall security posture.

### Current assets
Assets managed by the IT department at Botium Toys include:
- On-premises equipment supporting office operations
- Employee devices such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, remote workstations, and supporting peripherals
- Retail products sold through physical stores and online platforms, including warehouse storage
- Business systems and services, including accounting, telecommunications, databases, security systems, e-commerce platforms, and inventory management systems
- Internet access and internal network infrastructure

### Risk assessment

#### Risk description
Asset management at Botium Toys has not been implemented optimally. Existing security controls are limited and not fully aligned with national and international security regulations and standards. This situation exposes the organization to significant security risks, particularly related to sensitive data protection and business continuity.

### Control best practices
The recommended approach aligns with the Identify function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Botium Toys should allocate resources to identify and classify all existing assets. This process provides a foundation for understanding risk levels, prioritizing protection efforts, and evaluating the business impact of potential asset loss.

### Risk score
The overall risk score is 8 out of 10, indicating a high level of risk. This score reflects limited security controls and low adherence to compliance requirements and security best practices.

#### Additional risk considerations
The potential impact of asset loss is considered moderate due to the lack of clarity regarding which assets are most critical to operations. However, the likelihood of asset compromise and regulatory penalties is high, as security controls and data protection mechanisms are insufficient.
Specific findings include:
- All employees have broad access to internal data, including potential access to payment data and customer PII/SPII
- Encryption has not been implemented to protect credit card data processed and stored within internal systems
- Principles of least privilege and separation of duties have not been applied
- A firewall is implemented and configured with appropriate security rules
- Antivirus software is installed and actively monitored
- An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has not been implemented
- Disaster recovery plans and data backup mechanisms are not currently in place
- Data breach notification procedures for EU customers comply with the 72-hour requirement
- A password policy exists but does not meet modern complexity standards
- A centralized password management system has not been implemented

## Control categories

### Control categories
Cybersecurity controls are grouped into three primary categories based on their function and area of protection within an organization. This classification helps ensure that human, technological, and physical aspects of security are addressed through a defense-in-depth approach.
The control categories used in the Botium Toys audit include:
- Administrative / Managerial Controls
- Technical Controls
- Physical / Operational Controls
