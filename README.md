# Botium Toys: Internal Security Audit

# Introduction <a name="introduction">
This case study is part of my cybersecurity portfolio, focusing on an internal security audit assessment. The project uses Botium Toys, a fictitious toy retail company, as a realistic scenario to simulate an internal cybersecurity audit aligned with current industry practices. The study was completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera, specifically within the Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks course.

The audit aims to evaluate Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program and assess how well existing business practices align with industry standards and best practices. The primary focus is on identifying high-risk vulnerabilities, providing mitigation recommendations, and outlining an overall strategy to improve the organization’s security posture. Audit findings are documented clearly, supported by remediation plans, and structured to ensure effective communication with stakeholders.
